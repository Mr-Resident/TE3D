Tax Evasion 3D is a gameplay mod for GZDoom, inspired by Build games and various dystopian sci-fi works.
------------------------------------------------------------

About: Set in an alternate Earth, this mod pits you against an immoral, tyrannical federation's armed forces. Gun down agents, shock robots, blow up tanks, and send scientific abominations to the afterlife with a varied arsenal of tools for destruction. Don't expect a walk in the park, though; the enemy roster has been upgraded as much as your weapons have.

TE3D is, at its core, still Doom, covered in a very fancy, shiny coat of paint. The mod itself, however, takes a lot of inspiration from Build Engine games such as Duke Nukem 3D and Blood. Play not for a power fantasy, but to conquer a challenge. Damage RNG has been stripped out and replaced by consistent damage numbers.

Many enemies have alternate attacks with their own gimmicks and quirks; we recommend playing to learn them on your own, but below is a manual that explains the quirks. Weapons are a similar case.

Many features can be customized. Want different menu music? There are options, go wild. Don't want all the extra flare to the weapons, like smoke and casings? Go ahead and disable 'em. See the TAX EVASION 3D OPTIONS section of the menu to tinker to your heart's content.
